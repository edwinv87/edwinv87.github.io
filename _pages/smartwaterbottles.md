title: Smart Water Bottles

A smart water bottle contains a tiny embedded computer that is fitted onto a water bottle and runs a machine learning algorithm. It uses sensor data to detect the amount of water in your water bottle. It can detect your water drinking pattern and remind you when it is time to drink water or when it is time to refill your water bottle. It can keep track of your daily water consumption and interface with apps like the Apple Health app to record and present this data. You can also set your daily water drinking targets and the water bottle notifies you (through the app) if you are or are not meeting this target. 

Drinking enough water everyday is as important as exercise, good nutrition and enough sleep for a healthier lifestyle.
